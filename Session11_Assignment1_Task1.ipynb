    "and you try to learn from it. But if you have a small database and you are forced to come with a model based on \n",
    "that. In such situation, you can use a technique known as cross validation. In this method the dataset splits \n",

    "\n",
    "In this technique,  a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is \n",
